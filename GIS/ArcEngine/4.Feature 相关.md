### 2. esriFeatureType
> Feature 类型, 常量

| Constant    | Value    | Description |
| :---------- | :------- | :---------- |
| esriFTSimple	| 1	| Polygons, polylines, and points representing objects or places that have area, such as water bodies; linear objects, such as rivers; and localized positions, such as houses or sample sites.|
| esriFTSimpleJunction	| 7	| Simple junction feature in a geometric network representing point objects, such as a fuse, service point, or telephone pole.|
| esriFTSimpleEdge	| 8	| 	Simple edge feature in a geometric network representing polyline objects, such as primary or secondary overheads.|
| esriFTComplexJunction	| 9	| 	Complex junction feature in a geometric network, not in general use.|
